## Mage hand
...
#### Extension by Arcane Trickster
Starting at 3rd level, when you cast Mage Hand, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:

* You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.
* You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.
* You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.

You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check.

In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand

## Find familiar
1. Your familiar **acts independently** of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
2. When the familiar drops to **0 hit points, it disappears**, leaving behind no physical 
3.  dismiss/reappear familiar (100/30 ft)form. 
	* leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.
4. 100 ft communication telepathically. 
5. as an action, you can **see through your familiar's eyes and hear** what it hears until the start of your next turn, **gaining the benefits of any special senses** that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
6. On recast change type
7. delivering **touch spell** (100 ft) -> use its reactions
